- title: Underlining
  set_name: numderline
  desc: The flagship "Numderline" variant underlines alternating groups of 3 digits.
- title: Grouping
  set_name: ngroup
  desc: Squishes digits together into groups of 3. Nice looking and works for most fonts but annoying for editable text since it jumps around while typing.
- title: Bolding
  set_name: nbold
  desc: For fonts with lots of weights, we can make alternating groups slightly bolder.
- title: Commas
  set_name: nommas
  desc: Inserting fake commas is a good option in proportional contexts where changing the width doesn't matter.
- title: Monospace Commas
  set_name: monocommas
  desc: Using the grouping method we can make space to insert commas even in monospace fonts.
- title: Debug
  set_name: debug
  desc: The debug version shows how the font works, by using shaping tricks to replace digits with alternate versions that track the position modulo 7.
