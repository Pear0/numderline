- title: Underlining
  set_name: numderline
  desc: The flagship "Numderline" variant underlines alternating groups of 3 digits. It's what I use at work.
- title: Grouping
  set_name: ngroup
  desc: This variant squishes digits together into groups of 3. It's nice looking and works for most fonts but is annoying for editable text since it jumps around while typing.
- title: Bolding
  set_name: nbold
  desc: For fonts with lots of weights, making alternating groups slightly bolder is an alternative to underlines.
- title: Commas
  set_name: nommas
  desc: Inserting fake commas is a good option in proportional contexts where changing the width doesn't matter.
- title: Monospace Commas
  set_name: monocommas
  desc: By combining the grouping variant with tiny commas this variant adds commas while remaining monospaced.
- title: Debug
  set_name: debug
  desc: The debug version shows how the font uses shaping tricks to replace digits with alternate versions that track the position modulo 7.
