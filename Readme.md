# Hexderline (opinionated Numderline for hex)

## Fork Details

This is a fork of [thume's numderline](https://github.com/trishume/numderline) with a few changes:
- Merged this fix for `..` ranges [PR#10](https://github.com/trishume/numderline/pull/10)
- In hex literals 0x<ins>1234</ins>abcd, characters are grouped into 4 to better distinguish the bytes  
- Numbers that loosely look like a YYYYMMDD date are formatted as <ins>YYYY</ins>MM<ins>DD</ins>. As a loose heuristic for actual dates, this ligature requires the most significant digits of the year, month, and day to be reasonable.

## Intro

Numderline is a hacky font patcher that takes a font and converts it into one that underlines alternating groups of 3 digits starting from the right. It can also do other similar tricks.

It was inspired by [my job](https://www.janestreet.com/technology/) involving a lot of staring at numbers in nanoseconds and trying to pick out the milliseconds or microseconds.

A blog post about this and a web page to see and download pre-patched fonts should hopefully be coming soonâ„¢.

## Features

- Patch any font to underline alternating groups of 3 digits in numbers
- For use in proportional contexts, can also just insert fake commas with shaping
- Alternatively it can squish digits and group them closer together in threes
- Or some other variants, including small monospace mini-commas!

### Usage

1. Clone the repo
1. Install the FontForge Python API, on macOS I used Homebrew to do this with `brew install fontforge`, or you can use `brew bundle`
1. Install the fonttools API, I used `pip3 install fonttools` to install it in my Homebrew python3, or you can use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `python3 patcher.py FONT_FILE_TO_PATCH` and look in the `out` folder

You can also run `python3 patcher.py --help` and read the source to see other options.
