# Numderline

Numderline is a hacky font patcher that takes a font and converts it into one that underlines alternating groups of 3 digits starting from the right.

It was inspired by [my job](https://www.janestreet.com/technology/) involving a lot of staring at numbers in nanoseconds and trying to pick out the milliseconds or microseconds.
